compile with 

ifort make_lines.f90

Creates LINES_ADI.dat for specified elements, to provide info
on depacked components when using Adi's model atoms.

e.g., (Adi's data)
A10HHeN.dat corresponds with LINES_ADI.dat and FORMAL_INPUT_N_adi

whilst (standard data)
A10HHeN2345.dat corresponds with LINES_N2345.dat and FORMAL_INPUT_A10HHeN2345

NOTE: take care in Makefile that consistent LINES_xxx.dat file is
written to ATOM_FILE

NOTE also that optical NII lines (at least most) are provided in air
in long (depacked) line-files. Thus far, for these lines we use a
specific treatment NOT to change the wavelength (vacumm -> air for
lambda > 2000 A) in make_lines.f90. [other lines are converted].

Note also that LINES_ADI.dat can be used with formalsol, but all
damping coefficients have been set to zero.
