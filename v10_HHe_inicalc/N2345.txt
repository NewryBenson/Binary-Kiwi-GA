Some comments to the new N2345 model atom:

We performed litterally hundreds of tests, comparing with approx. 150
Gal/LMC/SMC stars on the observationally side, and comparing with
detail/surface for the accuracy of NII (old model atom) and NIII-NV with
cmfgen.

Recommended/tested lines are in FORMAL_INPUT_A10HHeN2345

1) NII should be roughly OK. When Norbert P. will release his new NII model
atom, we will incorporate this. Here, we recommend the following lines 
(part of which are commented out in FORMAL_INPUT) to be compared with the
observations (but see below, 'contamination').

3994.9970
4447.0330 
4601.4700 
4607.1600 
4621.3900
4630.5400 
4643.0900 
5005.1500
5007.3300 
5045.1030
5666.6300
5676.0149
5679.5540 
5710.7657
5941.6500

2) for dwarfs, NIII-V should be also OK, though NV could be tested only for
few stars with low resolution. Please see the included comparison for tau
Sco (tau_sco.ps). We obtain exactly the same abundance as Norbert P. in his
recent paper, with the only difference that we need a Teff of 500 K hotter.
green: obs (high resol, from a project with Nevy and Salvo Scuderi) 
black: 'new' solar 
red: N=8.17 (Norbert P, from NII alone: N=8.16)

3) the major discrepancy is for the NIII emission lines from giants and
supergiants. For a couple of stars, we found good agreement with the other
lines, but for most of the objects the lines are somewhat too weak. We
suspect (after a multitude of tests regarding ionization and collision cross
sections), that our model atom might need at least one principal quantum
number more. This might feed the upper level of the emission line
transition(s) indirectly over 4f.

Anyway, please note that the strength of the emission depends considerably
on beta (in the usual way, as for Halpha).

However, to implement the additional levels in a consistent way (preliminary
tests are under way) will take some time, and Jorge, who is working on
this, needs to do something different for the next three months. So, you can
implement all routines related to Nitrogen and begin with the comparisons,
but don't put too much stress on the NIII lines. (BTW, Paco's cmfgen lines
are mostly consistent with ours, except for the cooler objects where he has
somewhat more emission).

The most reliable lines from our present tests are the quartet lines NIII
4510/15/18, which you should consider as primary abundance indicators.

3) Regarding NIV, the strategic emission line (4058) from Paco is stronger
than ours, but for no object so far we had problems with our predictions.

There is also a nice NIV line around 6380. Please note that on the 'left' side
(approx. 6378.5) there is a feature (stronger and narrower -50 km/s- than NIV)
which we cannot identify. Does somebody know where this feature comes from?
(Please tell us). This feature overlaps with the NIV line for larger vsini or
bad resolution, giving the impression that the predicted NIV line is too weak.

4. Overall, it seems that the majority of the supergiants (Gal and LMC) are
strongly overabundant, by factors between 5 and 10 (one time even more). A
nice example is HD14947 (O5I), which can be fitted nicely for ALL NIII-lines
indicating an overabundance of 10. Accounting for the problem with the NIII
lines and that our fit predicts a bit too much NIV, a factor between 5 to 10
is more probable.

5. Here is a list of blends which can contaminate the N-lines (particularly
and as usual, from OII)

NII (only in blue range, for red range, check yourself)
4447    OII4448 (low f-value)
4601    OII4602
4607    OII4609
4630    (SiIV 4631, improbable, but just in case ...)
4643    OII, NIII 4641

NIII
4097    H-delta, OII 4097 !!!
4195/4200 HeII 4200
4510    NeII 4511 (two comp.)
4515    CIII 4515/16 (two comp, low f-value)
4640    OII 4638  (problematic for O9 and cooler)
4641    OII 4641 (even more probematic), NII 4643

Note that on the left of NIII 4634, there is a strong OIV (emission) line,
which might overlap in the wings, and there is also the SiIV line 4631

NIV
6380   unknown feature at 6378.5


Please report any problems to Jorge and me. Finally, please note that
all publications etc. based on this model atom (or improvements) should
include Jorge as co-author. 


Happy fitting, Jo.
