# pyEA
Genetic/Evolutionary Algorithm in python for fitting Fastwind models

A detailed description of the code will follow in Brands in prep.: 
"The R136 star cluster dissected with Hubble Space Telescope/STIS. 
  The wind properties of the most massive stars in the core of R136"

The code contains elements of the Pikaia algorithm of Charbonneau+ 1995, 
but in the basis is different. In practice, exploration is faster because
we employ a different way of mutation, amongst several other changes. 
The original method of Charbonneau, using parameters that are decoded in 
strings, is also implemented, but not extensively tested. 

== Very brief instructions for usage ==

Directory FW_inicalc:
- In the main directory, make a directory called FW_inicalc 
- Compile FASTWIND elsewhere, then copy everything in the inicalc directory 
   to FW_inicalc in the folder pyEA.
- Tested with FASTWIND version: V10.3.1dev (not in repository).

Running pyEA:
- The input should be put in a directory 'input/runname/' 
- There are 6 input files, examples are in the directory example_input. 
  Most are self explanatory, except control.txt that contains all the 
  meta parameters - a description/manual will follow.
- After preparing the input files, you can do a check by running 
  â€œpython pre_run_check.py runname" a report will then be printed in text, 
  and a plot with pdfs will be in the input folder of the source (also a 
  txt file that contains the printed text). Running this right before you 
  start the run prevents the run goes bad by silly mistakes in the input 
  files (visually check the output pdf!).
- The pre_run_check also generates a job script, but you should tailor 
  this ot the cluster on which you are running the code. A jobscript for 
  cartesius.surfsara can be found in the main directory. 
- The only "input" that should be set in the job script rather than one 
  of the input files, is whether you start a new run, or restart an old one. 
- After the run, you can run python GA_Analysis.py --> the version on 
  here now is old and will probably not work with current output, this 
  will be updated the coming days.
